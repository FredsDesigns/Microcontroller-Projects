# Microcontroller-Projects
Hello and welcome!
This is a gathered repository where I will be uploading all old/new projects I have worked that focus entirely with microcontrollers.
If your new to microcontroller programming, I highly recommend you to build the Two way communication project first, as its a great experience where you'll learn to solder (assuming your board outputs 5V and you need level shifters to transfer output volts to 3v3), directly use the SPI interface to communicate with your display, and get the chance to work a basic touchscreen device!
My other projects will teach you various skills ranging from SPI/I2C/PWM/ADC/WiFi/Interfacing/Filtering/Database collection/ and more!
I also will have a FPGA Project collection where I tend to write in VHDL, but will also feature SystemVerilog so please keep an eye open for that!
Various languages and IDEs are involved so please read the unique READMEs attached to each folder.
I mainly work through the C++ Language using the Arduino IDE library as has various library support to unique devices readily available so I highly suggest you download that first.

If you'd like to use a portion of the project to be included in your own projects, no need to ask! These projects are completely open source, all I ask is if you could please reference me in your implementation that would be greatly appreciated!
